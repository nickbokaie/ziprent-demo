                <p class="slider__txt"><strong>Ziprent</strong> has been a great service to use! I do short term rentals and they are able to constantly fill my units with reliable tenants. They are easy to work with and always available for assisting.</p>

                <p class="slider__txt">The process was very easy to follow. I found finding renters to be a lot easier than going about the process on my own!</p>

                <p class="slider__txt">I set it up my rental listing on <strong>Ziprent</strong> and immediately started receiving interest from all of the popular rental sites. The tenants applied through <strong>Ziprent</strong>, did the walkthrough and signed the lease through <strong>Ziprent</strong>, and they pay their rent automatically through <strong>Ziprent</strong>. <strong>Ziprent</strong> has gotten me to a point where the property management is completely hands-off, and my tenants are happy with it also!</p>

                <p class="slider__txt">I heard of <strong>Ziprent</strong> through a friend and contacted them. They quickly communicated with my tenant and took over the management of the property. Within a few days, they had all issues resolved and had a lease renewal signed. On top of the hands on stuff, through the portal, I can see what's going on with my property at all times. From repairs and invoices to rent collection. I couldn't have asked for a better company to deal with.</p>
